This is just something I came up with when I was searching for an appartment, and I wanted to know how long it would take me to go from the appartment to work.

Usage instructions:
  - clone this repo
  - npm i
  - edit the config variables in index.js
  - node index.js

Example output:

```javascript
    [ { from: 'Grafikvägen 28, 121 43 Johanneshov, Sweden',
      verbose: '14 mins',
      time: 14 },
    { from: 'Jungfrudansen 15, 171 50 Solna, Sweden',
      verbose: '14 mins',
      time: 14 },
    { from: 'Hagalundsgatan 24, 169 63 Solna, Sweden',
      verbose: '13 mins',
      time: 13 },
    { from: 'Johan Enbergs väg 22, 171 61 Solna, Sweden',
      verbose: '8 mins',
      time: 8 } ]
```
